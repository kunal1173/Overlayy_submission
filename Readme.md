# User Interaction Tracking Extension

This extension tracks user interactions on a website, such as clicks, hovers, scrolls, and typing. Using the collected data, it predicts the user's focus and intent with the help of Llama3, integrated via LangChain and Express.js.

## Methodology

1. **Tracking User Interactions**:
   - **Clicks**: Tracks where the user clicks on the webpage.
   - **Hovers**: Tracks where the user hovers their mouse pointer.
   - **Scrolls**: Tracks the scrolling behavior of the user.
   - **Typing**: Tracks the text the user types.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - The interaction data is stored as key-value pairs, where the key represents the action (e.g., a word typed) and the value represents the frequency of that action.

3. **Prediction with Llama3**:
   - The collected data is sent to an Express.js server.
   - LangChain is used to integrate Llama3 for processing the data.
   - Llama3 predicts the user's focus and intent based on the interaction data and maintains a state for generating responses based on previous interactions.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- Git installed on your local machine

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Set Up the Extension in the Browser**:
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder.

5. **Analyze Interests**:
   - Navigate to any webpage.
   - Click the "Analyze Interests" button in the extension popup to see the output generated by Llama3.

## Tracked Methods

- **Click**: Detects and logs the elements the user clicks on.
- **Hover**: Detects and logs the elements the user hovers over.
- **Scroll**: Detects and logs the user's scrolling behavior.
- **Typing**: Detects and logs the text the user types.

## Repository Structure

- `server.js`: Contains the Express.js server setup and LangChain integration with Llama3.
- `extension/`: Contains the Chrome extension files.
  - `manifest.json`: Extension manifest file.
  - `background.js`: Background script for the extension.
  - `content.js`: Content script that tracks user interactions.
  - `popup.html`: HTML file for the extension popup.
  - `popup.js`: JavaScript file for the extension popup logic.
- `sample/`: Contains example output generated for some cases.

## Future Plans

- Make the extension downloadable from the Chrome Store.
- Enhance the prediction model for better accuracy.
- Add more tracking methods for comprehensive user interaction analysis.
